Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn\\'s charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.

Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn\\'s ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.

[This is no hype or joke.]\\n\\nRegarding sex in literature, I try not to be prudish in my sensibilities, but I have sometimes been offended by \"filth\"--openly self-serving, very often freakish, and explicit sex--which serves no literary function other than as TNA & DNA pornography--usually written in a \"blue\" language of sexual explitives and expressions--and used only for the sake of selling smut books to lonely, sexually unfulfilled, mostly middle-class women. Most books such as these are terribly written by wanna-be and talentless writers.  A few do have real talent, but nonetheless are still manipulative seekers of mass-market suckers.\\n\\nIntrigued by the wide disparity of reviews expressed (hated-it/loved-it) for Lolita Files novel SEX.LIES.MURDER.FAME I decided to read it for myself and form my own opinion.  Here it is:  I think this novel was excellent!! Yes, the sex was raunchy and explicit, but it is exactly this which pimps, sexual predators, and sociopaths use to manipulate and/or degrade women--because it\\'s women they hate--and think are all stupid. The novel\\'s protaganist, Penn, is a sociopath, or as we old-schoolers would say, a psychopath. (A book which I correspondingly recommend for reading is THE SOCIOPATH NEXT DOOR.  Sociopaths are often CHARMING PEOPLE!!! Sometimes with very high IQ\\'s. But god help those who live next door to or who fall under the spell of any such \"pretty boys\"...like the notorious serial killer, Ted Bundy.\\n\\nLesson to be learned??? Plain men who get a \"pretty girl\" will almost certainly lose their money (perhaps, someone like Russell Simmons.) But plain or pretty women who get \"pretty boys\" might also lose their lives.\\n\\nI appreciated the wit and intelligence of Lolita Files in SLMF, particularly the way she used literary and philosophical theories and quotes as appropriate examples of the novel\\'s characters. Had some of the language and sex been less explicit and openly \"blue\" and a little more implied, it might be perceived as a masterwork of literature.

      "0  This was the first time I read Garcia-Aguilera.  I came upon the name of this book on Live with Regis and Kelly. This book was exactly what I was looking for ... it hit the spot.  I really enjoyed this book because it was well written. Once I started this book it kept me coming back for more. It had culture, family, friendship and romance. I was looking for a little more romance when I picked this book but in the end it turned out to be just right.  I love the main chartachter Margarita (aka Daisy). I've never been to Miami but the way Daisy told the story I certainly felt I'd been there.\\nAlso after going through all of Daisy's perils ... I closed the book with a feeling I had grown emotionally as well.\n",

       "      <td>Set amid the backdrop of New York City's impervious and highly competitive literary world, a disinherited, struggling writer, Penn Hamilton, plots his course to stardom.  Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn's charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.  When Beryl discovers that Penn has another lover and threatens to expose him and ruin his budding career, Penn ends the charade by committing a heinous crime.\\n\\nThis novel is a dark comedy, filled with cynicism and wit, and a touch of satire surrounding literary figures (editors, agents, etc.) and concepts (Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk).  Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn's ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.  Through Penn, the reader hangs with the \"in crowd\" and meets modern icons in today's entertainment arena.\\n\\nIf readers are adventurous enough to veer away from the \"Reesy and Misty\" novels and are patient enough to appreciate the rather lengthy passages dedicated to character development, the underlying ripples of black humor, and the clever infusion of actual literary works and personalities, I think File's fans may appreciate this book as an enriched departure from her traditional `girlfriend' type of novels.\\n\\nReviewed by Phyllis\\n\\nAPOOO BookClub</td>\n",

I came upon the name of this book on Live with Regis and Kelly. This book was exactly what I was looking for ... it hit the spot.  I really enjoyed this book because it was well written. Once I started this book it kept me coming back for more. It had culture, family, friendship and romance. I was looking for a little more romance when I picked this book but in the end it turned out to be just right.  I love the main chartachter Margarita (aka Daisy). I've never been to Miami but the way Daisy told the story I certainly felt I'd been there.\\nAlso after going through all of Daisy's perils ... I closed the book with a feeling I had grown emotionally as well.   \n",

Successful deviation from past Lupe Solano series-captures the very essence of the excitement, local color and diverse fabric of MIAMI. Sensual and culturally enlightened!   \n",

Being a guy, I was a little hesitant about reading a romance novel but I just had to give this book a shot because I have been such a huge fan of Garcia-Aguilera's books.  And to be honest, I absolutely loved this book.  I love the way she presents funky Miami and its crazy Cubans in not just this book but all her books.  Garcia-Aguilera did a superb job with this book, and I can't wait till her next book.  You gotta read this book!!!!   \n",

I have read and love all her mysteries- so I picked up this romance with eager anticipation. I was not disappointed. The main character Margarita is easily likeable, which makes the trials she faces that much more intriguing. Sometimes you want to yell at the book and tell Margarita what she should (and shouldn't) do. But the author is measured in the development of the plot and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Mix that in with an interesting take on Cuban exile politics and humorous insights on the world around Margarita and the picture of wild, steamy Miami is complete. Another winner from Garcia-Aguilera.   \n",

Actually, it's long overdue. Therefore, I highly recommend you read this book. I promise you won't be disappointed. If this doesn't make the bestsellers list something is definitely wrong here. This well written story is so engaging, funny, almost true, etc. The character Beryl was funny and sad. Unfortunately, there are women just like her and people take advantage of them. What we won't do for love. Penn said, women can be so stupid. He told her he love her on their first night together and she belived him. That was her demise right there.   \n",

Dark. Reading the book you could almost feel the train wreck about to happen.  The collision of characters is painful yet stimulating.  Files show the depth of her writing in this book especially by showcasing her ethnically diverse cast.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but if you can get past the initial character introductions you'll be hooked!  The sex and graphic violence can be overwhelming and hard to stomach, but it's what makes this book...the book.  If you like tidiness this isn't the book for you...it's everything, but tidy.  Personally, I was slightly disappointed in the final direction of the book, but from a literary perspective this is close to a masterpiece.  Her books just keep getting better and better.  This one really pushes the reader mentally and educationally through her use of real literary terms and vocabulary words that may require a quick tour through Webster's.   \n",
       "9  Set amid the backdrop of New York City's impervious and highly competitive literary world, a disinherited, struggling writer, Penn Hamilton, plots his course to stardom.  Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn's charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.  When Beryl discovers that Penn has another lover and threatens to expose him and ruin his budding career, Penn ends the charade by committing a heinous crime.\\n\\nThis novel is a dark comedy, filled with cynicism and wit, and a touch of satire surrounding literary figures (editors, agents, etc.) and concepts (Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk).  Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn's ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.  Through Penn, the reader hangs with the \"in crowd\" and meets modern icons in today's entertainment arena.\\n\\nIf readers are adventurous enough to veer away from the \"Reesy and Misty\" novels and are patient enough to appreciate the rather lengthy passages dedicated to character development, the underlying ripples of black humor, and the clever infusion of actual literary works and personalities, I think File's fans may appreciate this book as an enriched departure from her traditional `girlfriend' type of novels.\\n\\nReviewed by Phyllis\\n\\nAPOOO BookClub   \n",

       "      <td>Set amid the backdrop of New York City's impervious and highly competitive literary world, a disinherited, struggling writer, Penn Hamilton, plots his course to stardom.  Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn's charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.  When Beryl discovers that Penn has another lover and threatens to expose him and ruin his budding career, Penn ends the charade by committing a heinous crime.\\n\\nThis novel is a dark comedy, filled with cynicism and wit, and a touch of satire surrounding literary figures (editors, agents, etc.) and concepts (Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk).  Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn's ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.  Through Penn, the reader hangs with the \"in crowd\" and meets modern icons in today's entertainment arena.\\n\\nIf readers are adventurous enough to veer away from the \"Reesy and Misty\" novels and are patient enough to appreciate the rather lengthy passages dedicated to character development, the underlying ripples of black humor, and the clever infusion of actual literary works and personalities, I think File's fans may appreciate this book as an enriched departure from her traditional `girlfriend' type of novels.\\n\\nReviewed by Phyllis\\n\\nAPOOO BookClub</td>\n",

Successful deviation from past Lupe Solano series-captures the very essence of the excitement, local color and diverse fabric of MIAMI. Sensual and culturally enlightened!   \n",

Being a guy, I was a little hesitant about reading a romance novel but I just had to give this book a shot because I have been such a huge fan of Garcia-Aguilera's books.  And to be honest, I absolutely loved this book.  I love the way she presents funky Miami and its crazy Cubans in not just this book but all her books.  Garcia-Aguilera did a superb job with this book, and I can't wait till her next book.  You gotta read this book!!!!   \n",

I have read and love all her mysteries- so I picked up this romance with eager anticipation. I was not disappointed. The main character Margarita is easily likeable, which makes the trials she faces that much more intriguing. Sometimes you want to yell at the book and tell Margarita what she should (and shouldn't) do. But the author is measured in the development of the plot and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Mix that in with an interesting take on Cuban exile politics and humorous insights on the world around Margarita and the picture of wild, steamy Miami is complete. Another winner from Garcia-Aguilera.   \n",

Actually, it's long overdue. Therefore, I highly recommend you read this book. I promise you won't be disappointed. If this doesn't make the bestsellers list something is definitely wrong here. This well written story is so engaging, funny, almost true, etc. The character Beryl was funny and sad. Unfortunately, there are women just like her and people take advantage of them. What we won't do for love. Penn said, women can be so stupid. He told her he love her on their first night together and she belived him. That was her demise right there.   \n",

Dark. Reading the book you could almost feel the train wreck about to happen.  The collision of characters is painful yet stimulating.  Files show the depth of her writing in this book especially by showcasing her ethnically diverse cast.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but if you can get past the initial character introductions you'll be hooked!  The sex and graphic violence can be overwhelming and hard to stomach, but it's what makes this book...the book.  If you like tidiness this isn't the book for you...it's everything, but tidy.  Personally, I was slightly disappointed in the final direction of the book, but from a literary perspective this is close to a masterpiece.  Her books just keep getting better and better.  This one really pushes the reader mentally and educationally through her use of real literary terms and vocabulary words that may require a quick tour through Webster's.   \n",
       "9  Set amid the backdrop of New York City's impervious and highly competitive literary world, a disinherited, struggling writer, Penn Hamilton, plots his course to stardom.  Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn's charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.  When Beryl discovers that Penn has another lover and threatens to expose him and ruin his budding career, Penn ends the charade by committing a heinous crime.\\n\\nThis novel is a dark comedy, filled with cynicism and wit, and a touch of satire surrounding literary figures (editors, agents, etc.) and concepts (Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk).  Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn's ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.  Through Penn, the reader hangs with the \"in crowd\" and meets modern icons in today's entertainment arena.\\n\\nIf readers are adventurous enough to veer away from the \"Reesy and Misty\" novels and are patient enough to appreciate the rather lengthy passages dedicated to character development, the underlying ripples of black humor, and the clever infusion of actual literary works and personalities, I think File's fans may appreciate this book as an enriched departure from her traditional `girlfriend' type of novels.\\n\\nReviewed by Phyllis\\n\\nAPOOO BookClub   \n",
