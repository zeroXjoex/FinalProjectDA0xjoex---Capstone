Born with dastardly good looks and a genius I.Q., Penn seduces the top editor in the business, Beryl Unger.  Beryl is a homely, narcoleptic, obsessive-compulsive workaholic who instantly falls for Penn\\'s charms and his manuscript.  The spin-doctors are engaged and Penn, as much as his novel, is an overnight sensation.  The money, power, respect, and women ensue.

Files offers a credible plot behind the evolution of Penn\\'s ascent as an artist and embodiment of himself as a \"brand\" spanning all genres - music, fashion, literature, cinema, even legal scandals - the total package.  He becomes an infamous, opportunistic, conniving, heartless protagonist - and yet, he is still fairly likeable.  Files keeps the novel fresh and hip.

Plain men who get a \"pretty girl\" will almost certainly lose their money (perhaps, someone like Russell Simmons.)

Even so, I enjoyed the book, and read selected passages (sans some of the blue notes) to my 22 year old and very religious daughter. Because women--all women--need to hear and know the things Lolita Files teaches--things which are much more effective (Straight, no chaser) when told by other women.

The first chapter of this book was just a little too much Beryl, but I guess Ms Files felt like we needed a solid understanding of Beryl and she was right.
